# Sorting Visualizer

A sorting visualizer is a tool that helps you visualize how different sorting algorithms work. With this project, you can generate random arrays of different sizes and see the animations of the sorting algorithms run at custom speeds.

## Features

- Generate random arrays of different sizes
- Visualize sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort.
- Control the speed of the sorting animation
- Easy to use and intuitive user interface
- Built with React and Redux


## Technology Stack

- React
- Redux
